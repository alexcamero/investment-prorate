This was a project I completed for a job interview so it won't be interesting on its own, but if you're interested in running it there is a startup script in the root folder for you to run (won't work in windows, I don't think). You'll either need docker or node installed for the script to work.

Note: I didn't include the icons here since I do not own them.
